NAME
    Gitalist - A modern git web viewer

SYNOPSIS
        script/gitalist_server.pl

INSTALL
    As Gitalist follows the usual Perl module format the usual approach for
    installation should work e.g

      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make test
      make install

    If you're running a git checkout of Gitalist then you'll additionally
    need the author modules.

DESCRIPTION
    Gitalist is a web frontend for git repositories based on gitweb.cgi and
    backed by Catalyst.

  History
    This project started off as an attempt to port gitweb.cgi to a Catalyst
    app in a piecemeal fashion. As it turns out, thanks largely to Florian
    Ragwitz's earlier effort, it was easier to use gitweb.cgi as a template
    for building a new Catalyst application.
