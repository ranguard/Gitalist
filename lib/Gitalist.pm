=head1 NAME

Gitalist - A modern git web viewer

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    script/gitalist_server.pl

=head1 INSTALL

As Gitalist follows the usual Perl module format the usual approach
for installation should work e.g

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

If you're running a git checkout of Gitalist then you'll additionally
need the author modules.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Gitalist is a web frontend for git repositories based on gitweb.cgi
and backed by Catalyst.

=head2 History

This project started off as an attempt to port gitweb.cgi to a
Catalyst app in a piecemeal fashion. As it turns out, thanks largely
to Florian Ragwitz's earlier effort, it was easier to use gitweb.cgi
as a template for building a new Catalyst application.
